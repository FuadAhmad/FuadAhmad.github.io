        <h3>Bacground</h3>
        <p>I am from Bangladesh. I grew up in a village where there was no electricity while I was in high school. My father, who could not finish his college due to the hardship of life, always expected and did everything to make sure I finish my engineering degree. I have two younger siblings studying in college and in a university, whom I need to support sometimes. I hope I will graduate soon then get a decent job and will help others. </p>

        <h3> Career Goal</h3>
        <p>I have an MSc degree and Pursuing PhD in Computer Science focusing on Data Science and Machine Learning. I am interested in working on complex, big and real life projects. I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set. I want to be a research scientist and work towards being a researcher.</p>

        <h3> Why?</h3>
        <p> Data science refers to preparing and pre-process the data and modeling data to uncover useful information. Machine Learning focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from data to make predictions or take actions without human intervention. Machine learning has many real-world applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and more. Machine learning has a lot of potential applications in the medical sector. For example, machine learning algorithms can be trained on medical imaging data (such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans) to identify signs of cancer. It is also being used widely in the autonomous vehicle industry, helping to improve safety and reduce the risk of accidents. I hope I will be able to contribute in these fields.</p>
